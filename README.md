# SWI-Prolog Repository

Welcome to the SWI-Prolog Repository! This repository contains various Prolog files showcasing logical representations, relationships, and implementations in the Prolog programming language.

## Files Overview:

1. **file.pl:**
   - **Content Overview:**
     - Defines predicates and rules for relationships between people, food, life status, and preferences.
   - **Logic Demonstrated:**
     - Facts and rules regarding people, their status (alive or killed), food, eating habits, and preferences.
   - **Usage:**
     - Explore relationships, food choices, and logical implications within the defined predicates.
   - **Disclaimer:**
     - Simplified examples for educational purposes; not exhaustive or for production use.

2. **first.pl:**
   - **Content Overview:**
     - Introduces simple facts and relationships between individuals, attributes, and numbers.
   - **Logic Demonstrated:**
     - Basic facts about friendships, a singer, and an odd number.
   - **Usage:**
     - Understand basic relationships and facts within the defined predicates.
   - **Disclaimer:**
     - Provides elementary examples for learning Prolog fundamentals.

3. **minor1.pl:**
   - **Content Overview:**
     - Contains predicates and rules depicting relationships between people, food, survival, and preferences.
   - **Logic Demonstrated:**
     - Predicates related to people, food choices, survival logic, and likes/dislikes.
   - **Usage:**
     - Investigate relationships, food preferences, and survival conditions within the defined predicates.
   - **Disclaimer:**
     - Simplified logic examples designed for educational purposes.

4. **nodes.pl:**
   - **Content Overview:**
     - Defines predicates and rules establishing paths between nodes in a graph.
   - **Logic Demonstrated:**
     - Graph representation using edges and rules for path finding between nodes.
   - **Usage:**
     - Explore graph traversal and path-finding functionalities within the defined predicates.
   - **Disclaimer:**
     - Provides basic examples of graph theory implementation in Prolog.

5. **factorial.pl:**
   - **Content Overview:**
     - Contains a Prolog predicate for calculating factorials.
   - **Logic Demonstrated:**
     - Predicate to calculate factorials using recursion.
   - **Usage:**
     - Query the `factorial/2` predicate to calculate factorials.
   - **Disclaimer:**
     - Simplified factorial calculation for educational purposes.

6. **family.pl:**
   - **Content Overview:**
     - Defines facts and rules representing familial relationships.
   - **Logic Demonstrated:**
     - Parent-child relationships established by `parent/2` predicate, and rules inferring `father` and `mother` relationships.
   - **Usage:**
     - Explore familial relationships using defined predicates.
   - **Disclaimer:**
     - Basic familial relationship examples for educational purposes.

## How to Use:
1. **Loading Files:**
   - Load any desired file (e.g., `consult('file.pl').`) into an SWI-Prolog interpreter or environment.

2. **Querying Predicates:**
   - Query-defined predicates in each file to explore relationships, facts, or specific functionalities.

3. **Contribution:**
   - Feel free to enhance or expand upon existing files or create new Prolog files to contribute to the repository.

<!-- ## Disclaimer:
- These files are designed for educational purposes and demonstrate simplified logic and relationships.
- They may not cover all real-world scenarios or be suitable for production use. -->

Any inquiries, suggestions, or contributions are welcomed.
